### 3. **Statistics Dashboard**

## 🎨 User Interface

### Notification Card Components:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📢 [Icon] SUBJECT            [Badge]    │
│ ⏰ 2 hours ago                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Notification message content...         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ℹ️ From: HotelMaster Admin              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Color Coding:
- **General Notifications**: Green theme (#10b981)
  - Shows group icon
  - "GENERAL" badge
  - Visible to all users

- **Personal Notifications**: Orange theme (#f59e0b)
  - Shows user icon
  - "PERSONAL" badge
  - Visible only to specific recipient

## 📱 Backend Implementation

### New API Endpoint
```
GET /api/notifications/user/:userId
```

**What it does:**
- Fetches notifications for a specific user
- Returns notifications where:
  - `recipientType === 'all'` (sent to everyone), OR
  - `recipientType === 'specific'` AND user is in recipients list

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "...",
    "recipientType": "all",
    "subject": "Special Offer",
    "message": "Get 20% off...",
    "sentBy": "Admin",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  },
  {
    "_id": "...",
    "recipientType": "specific",
    "recipients": ["userId1", "userId2"],
    "subject": "Personal Message",
    "message": "Thank you for...",
    "sentBy": "Admin",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T09:15:00.000Z"
  }
]
```
